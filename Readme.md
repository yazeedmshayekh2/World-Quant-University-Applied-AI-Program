# World Quant University | Applied AI Program

We are pleased to announce WQU’s newly launched Applied AI Lab: [Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.wqu.edu/ai-lab-computer-vision?utm_campaign=AI%20Lab%20Launch&utm_source=piazza).

As with all our programs, the AI Lab’s curriculum has been developed by industry experts to give learners the rigorous, foundational tools to advance in this rapidly evolving field of machine learning and AI.

## Why Computer Vision?

Computer vision stands out as one of the most accessible and impactful applications of deep learning with its use of neural networks to address complex data. Its ability to solve real-world problems makes it the ideal starting point for those ready to master artificial intelligence in an applied setting. Beyond its use in specialized roles such as computer vision engineering, AI research, and robotics development, these skills are increasingly valuable in healthcare, where medical imaging aids diagnostics; agriculture, for monitoring crop health; and security, with applications in surveillance and biometrics.

Delivered on a virtual machine platform, this self-paced Lab offers hands-on learning, focusing on practical computer vision applications from wildlife conservation to facial recognition. Through six projects, participants will:

- Master neural networks.
- Develop data analysis techniques for images and video.
- Build models for image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.
- Explore generative AI techniques.
  
You will graduate from the AI Lab with a sharable portfolio of projects and be equipped with end-to-end computer vision skills, from data preparation and ETL processes to model development and deployment, enabling you to solve real-world challenges across industries. Whether creating facial recognition systems, developing object detection models, or leveraging AI for sustainable agriculture, you’ll be ready to solve real-world challenges with confidence and responsibility.

## Is the Applied AI Lab right for you?

The Lab is best suited for learners with proficiency in Python and libraries like NumPy and Pandas, an understanding of linear algebra and calculus fundamentals, and familiarity with machine learning concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning.

If you’re new to Python or machine learning, we recommend starting with foundational training, such as our **Applied Data Science Lab**, to build the skills needed for success.
